*The **Bloodshatter Axe of Shadow Mountain** is actually the fabled blade **Ever After**.* 

Each time you would suffer a level of exhaustion, it transfers to the axe as two levels of exhaustion instead. Neither you nor the axe suffers penalties from the levels of exhaustion at this time. When your attunement to the item ends, you instantly gain all levels of exhaustion stored in the axe and suffer their normal effects.
